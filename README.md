Our Circle

Our Circle is an app designed for families, friends, and even colleagues to create groups or “Circles” that help keep track of events, notes, photos and calendars that pertain to the individuals assigned to that specific Circle. This was created with React, MySQL, Sequelize, JavaScript, Sass, HTML, and CSS.
