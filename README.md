# Our Circle

## Description
Our Circle is an application made for groups of people looking to stay closely connected. Whether it be a family, group of friends or colleagues, Our Circle makes it possible for members to privately share moments and information with one another. Each group's Circle provides a place to collaborate, stay organized and up-to-date on daily ventures. It is designed for members to share calendar events, post messages, create lists and upload photos for those in their select Circle to see and expand on.
